Hello. Welcome to Dodge Arena. To preview this application, install the PhoneGap desktop application. In the PhoneGap Application, select the folder that you have cloned the project to, then run the file on the server it provides. 

To make any changes, go to the www folder and the sketch.js, player.js, spear.js, bullet.js, explosion.js, and index.html will be the primary files to change.

JavaScript is used for development and p5.js is the library used for creating the canvas and positioning the elements.
